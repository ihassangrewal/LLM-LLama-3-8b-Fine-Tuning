🦙 LLaMA 3 8B Fine-Tuning – Instruction-Based Language Model Training

This project focuses on fine-tuning Meta’s LLaMA 3 8B large language model for instruction-following tasks using Python and Hugging Face’s transformers and PEFT libraries. The model was trained on a custom dataset and optimized for performance on specific downstream applications.

🎯 Objectives
	•	Fine-tune LLaMA 3 8B model on domain-specific instruction data
	•	Utilize parameter-efficient tuning techniques (e.g., LoRA)
	•	Evaluate generation quality and instruction adherence
	•	Enable reproducible training pipeline using Colab/Notebooks

🧠 Technologies & Libraries
	•	Python
	•	Hugging Face Transformers
	•	Datasets
	•	PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning)
	•	Accelerate
	•	Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook

⚙️ How to Run
	1.	Open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter
	2.	Ensure you have access to the Hugging Face model repository (may require token)
	3.	Prepare your dataset in instruction-tuning format (e.g., Alpaca-style JSONL)
	4.	Run the notebook step by step to fine-tune LLaMA 3 8B with LoRA
	5.	Save and evaluate the output model

📝 Dataset Format Example
{
“instruction”: “Summarize this article”,
“input”: “OpenAI released GPT-4 in 2023…”,
“output”: “OpenAI introduced a multimodal model capable of text and image inputs.”
}

📊 Key Features
	•	Supports LoRA for memory-efficient training
	•	Easily integrates with custom instruction datasets
	•	Compatible with Hugging Face Hub
	•	Generates sample outputs after training

🚀 Future Work
	•	Deploy model with FastAPI or Gradio
	•	Automate training and dataset preprocessing
